        <h3> Programming paradigms:-</h3>Paradigms can also be termed as method/stategy to solve some problems or do some task.programming paradigm is an approach to solve 
        a problem using tools and techniques that are  available to us following some approach. There are alot of programming language that are known but all of them need to follow some stategy when they are implemented and this methodology stategy is paradigms.
        <br><br>
       <span class="spa"> THE PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS ARE OF TWO TYPES:</span>
        <BR>
             <MARK>1.Imperative programming paradigms<br></MARK>
             <MARK>2.Declarative programming paradigms</MARK><BR>
                <br>

           <b>1.Imperative programming paradigms:-</b>it is one of the oldest programming paradigms.it's features are closely related to machine arrchitecture.And this is performed as step by step task
         by changing state.we keep our focus on this kind of program how to achive the goal.
         <br>
        Moreover this paradigms contain three sub paradigms<br>
        A.Procedural programming paradigms<br>
        B.Object oriented programming<br>
        C.Parallel processing approach 
    <BR>
        <BR>
           <span class="spa2"> ADVANTAGES:-</span>It have some advantagers like very simple to implemnt and contain loops variable etc..<br>

      <span class="spa3">DISADVATAGES:-</span>By this complex problem are can"t be solved and parallel programming is not possible.<br>
      
    <br><br>
   <b> A.Procedural programming paradigms:-</b>This kind of programming paradigms is based on the procedure calls concept. In this program instructions are structured into procedures. it means a list of instruction are given to the computer to execute step by step process.
    we call procedural programming as top-down languages.<br><br>


    <b>B.Object oriented programming:-</b> object is the real world entity, we write the program as a collection of class and object in object oriented programming. And object is the basic entity we related real world entity with our program by using object.
     <br><br>

<b>C.Parallel processing approach:-</b>
