    <h1>streams</h1><br>
    
    <P><b>STREAM:</b> A stream is a sequence of bytes which have source and destination. we need streams to control the input and output operation.To done I/O operation streams provides some predefine classes and objects.
        In C++ mainly we us two types of streams <mark>input stream</mark> and <mark>output stream</mark>.<br>
        <br>
        The first main class is IOS class and in this class we have another two sub classes, Like <mark>istream</mark> and <mark>ostream</mark> predefine classes. 
        istream controls the input operation and ostream controls the output operations.To done this two operation at one place we hava another class called <mark>iostrem</mark> class. And the main thing is iostream is the combination of both istream and ostream classes.<br>
        <br>
        
        All this four predefine classes present under one class called iostream.h, iostream.h is a header file.
        To do i/o operation in our program we have to us this header file<mark>(#include < iostream.h >). </mark>presently we are using new version compilers like Dev C++ in this compiler we us <mark>#include< iostream > </mark> along with this we use <mark>using namespace std;</mark>  
        <br>
        Let's hava overview of this, in c programming language we use < stdio.h> to control i/o operation in our program, here in c++ we use iostream.h header file.
        <br><br> 
        Till now we talk istream is for input operation but we don't know  how this operation is done, To done this operation istream class provide one  predefine object 
        called <mark>cin</mark>. In C we use scanf() function to give input data to our program, here we use cin object.<br>
        <br>
        Let's have a small talk about ostream class, this class provides a predefine class called <mark>cout</mark> object. Cout object is used  to display the output on the screen, it's function is like a printf() function in C language.</P>
